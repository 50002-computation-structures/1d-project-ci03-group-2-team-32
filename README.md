# 2025 50.002 1D Project

## Project Overview

For our 50.002 Computation Structures project, we built an arcade machine using a single **𝗔𝗹𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗔𝘂 𝗙𝗣𝗚𝗔** (Xilinx Artix 7). The machine features:

- 🔳 **16x16 LED Matrix:** Serves as the display screen, with each individual LED programmed for custom graphics.
- ▶️ **Movement & Shoot Buttons:** Hardware is programmed with edge detectors to accurately detect single button presses across clock cycles.
- 🔢 **Seven Segment Displays:** Used to show score and time. Data from regfiles is converted to binary for correct number display.
- 🖥️ **Beta CPU and Instruction Set Architecture:** Designed and implemented with a program counter, REGFILE, ALU, and Control Unit, all coded as Alchitry Lucid modules.

## Initial Readme
This starter template is created using Alchitry Lab V2, written in LucidV2 language. Full documentation can be found at [Alchitry's official website](https://alchitry.com/tutorials/).
